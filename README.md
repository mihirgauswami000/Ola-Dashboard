Ola Ride Analytics: Interactive Dashboard for Ride & Revenue Insights
A dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Ola ride data across Bangalore, focusing on booking behavior, vehicle performance, cancellation trends, revenue flow, and customer-driver experience.

2.Short Description / Purpose
The Ola Ride Analytics Dashboard is an interactive, data-rich report built to uncover insights from thousands of ride records for June 2025. It helps visualize booking trends, cancellation reasons, revenue distribution, and satisfaction metrics to support operational and customer-experience improvements.

3.Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• Power BI Desktop – For designing and publishing interactive visual reports.
•  Power Query – Used to clean, format, and transform raw data into usable tables.
•  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures like booking success %, average ratings, and total revenue.
•  Data Modeling – Relationships created between core entities such as customers, bookings, and vehicle types.
•  File Format – .pbix for development and .png for screenshots and sharing.

4.Data Source
Source: Simulated ride data based on Ola’s structure and ride operations.
Structure:
The dataset includes ~100,000 records for June 2025 and contains the following key columns:

Booking ID, Date, Time
Booking Status (Success, Cancelled, Incomplete)
Customer ID, Driver Ratings, Customer Ratings
Vehicle Types (Auto, Mini, Bike, Prime Plus, etc.)
Pickup & Drop Locations (50 dummy areas across Bangalore)
Ride Distance, Booking Value
Reasons for cancellation by both customers and drivers
Average Vehicle Time to Arrival (VTAT) and Customer Time to Arrival (CTAT)

5.Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
Ola handles a large volume of bookings every day. Understanding where and why rides are canceled, how vehicle types perform, and how customers rate services is crucial—but not easy to see from raw data.

Questions such as:
Why are rides being cancelled?
Which vehicle types deliver better experiences?
Which customers or regions generate the most revenue?
…require a dashboard for quick, insightful analysis.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To build a real-time analytics platform that:
Tracks ride volume and booking trends
Highlights cancellation reasons and service gaps
Analyzes vehicle popularity and performance
Provides insights into driver vs. customer rating patterns
Informs revenue decisions by tracking payment method trends
